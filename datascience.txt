machine learning:
machine learning is a study of algo and statistics

supervised learning:
data you are going to predict 
.regression
.classification


unsupervised learning:
based on grouping of data
.
clustering


reinforcement learning:
find problem and provide solution
...



aritchmetic progression:


mode:the value repeat more times

measure of dispersion:

1.range:

difference between the high and low value

8 ,7,5,3,5,2





2.interquartile range:

quartile:
among the data we are breaking the data set into quarters


q1=25%
q2=40%
q3=60%
q4=10%

Iqr=q3-q4

Iqr=60-10

IQR=50%

3.s.d:square root of var

4.variance:it is avg of square deviation about the mean

skewness:


kurtosis:


Data visualization:

pictoril representation of data


types of data virtualization :

1.Histogram

2.pie chart

3.Bar chat

ho--verti

4.box-plot
line plot

5.scatter


Outlier:

Different from other we say as outlier.(which is out of normal condition)


probability distribution:

probability:

Binomial Distribution:Poosible number of successive outcome




b(x,n,p)=n Cx Px*(1-p)n-x




mean


possion dist:

number of events occuring in a given period

1.number of exams in a four year

2.number of product sold in a month


3.number of car accident in 2018

4.number of typing error on a given page.

r


correlation:connection between two var or mutual relationship

v1----------v2-----------v3-------------v4


r(co-eff of correlation)

r>0===positive

r<0--negative

r=0 no relationship


cor(a,b)=E((a-E(a))(b-E(b))




confidential interval:can able to estimate a range of value.

z-score:
no of s.d from the mean value we call this as z-score


Regression:

Multi-linear regression:




Logistic Regression:

Logical Regression is one of the basic and popular algorithm to solve a classifiation problem

Classification:
